# To tolerate pod deletion during a node drain, we can set a podDisruptionBudget
#  with a minAvailable. For example minAvailable: "9999" means pod eviction is allowed as long as there
# are 9999 healthy pod left for the workflow. Normally this number should be slightly greater than the pod
# number created by the workflow. Give an arbitrary big number if you don't know how many pods workflow creates

# The retry can be at workflow(in this example), or at template level(in flow_with_template_retry.yaml).
