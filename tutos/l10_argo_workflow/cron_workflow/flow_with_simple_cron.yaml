  # schedule defines how the job repeats, it uses the same syntax as the linux crontab syntax, 
  # the five star is in order of [Minute] [Hour] [Day_of_the_Month] [Month_of_the_Year] [Day_of_the_Week],
  # Note in the new linux release, you can add an optional six star to fefine year.
  # 1: */2 means every two mins. If you want every min after 6 min, you write 6/1. 8/2 means every 2 min after 8 min
  # As a result, the two numbers must in range of [0,59]
  # 2: For hours, the two numbers must in range of [0,23]
  # 3: For day of the month, the two numbers must in range of [1,31] 
  # 4: For month of year, the two numbers must in range of [1,12]
  # For day of the week, the two number must in range of [0,7], where 0 and 7 means Sunday
  # "* * * * *" means the job will be running every second, every min, every hour, every
  schedule: "*/3 * * * *"
  # if the job is long to finish, the schedule may start a new job without finishing the old one. Thus you need to set a policy to allow concurrency or
  # not.
  # It has three possible values
  # - "Allow" (default). 
  # - "Forbid" Ignore the new schedule job until the old job finishes
  # - "Replace" The new schedule job replaces the unfinish old job
  concurrencyPolicy: "Replace"
  # It stands for the deadline in seconds for starting the job if it misses its scheduled time for any reason. After the deadline, 
  # the cron job does not start the job. Jobs that do not meet their deadline in this way count as failed jobs. 
  # If this field is not specified, the jobs have no deadline.
