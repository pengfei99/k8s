##################### work avoidance. #######################################
# A workflow that utilizes this is simply a workflow containing steps that do not run if the work has already
# been done. This simplest way to do this is to use marker files.
# Use cases:
# - An expensive step appears across multiple workflows - you want to avoid repeating them.
# - A workflow has unreliable tasks - you want to be able resubmit the workflow.


# This example shows how to use a PVC and optional input artifacts to avoid work.
