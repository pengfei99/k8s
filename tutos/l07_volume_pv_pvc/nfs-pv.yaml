# volume mode defines how the PV is mounted on a pod, only two possible value: Filesystem, Block
# Filesystem mode: PV is mounted into Pods as a directory. If the PV is backed by a block device and the device is empty, 
#                  Kuberneretes creates a filesystem on the device before mounting it for the first time.
# Block mode: PV is mounted into a Pod as a block device, without any filesystem on it. This mode is useful to provide a Pod 
#             the fastest possible way to access a volume, without any filesystem layer between the Pod and the volume.
#             On the other hand, the application running in the Pod must know how to handle a raw block device.
